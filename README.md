# FaMAF CVA6 Project

The reference RISC-V core for the FaMAF CVA6 Project, and the starting point for new members.

This repository is a frozen fork of the [OpenHW Group CORE-V CVA6](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6), a 64-bit, 6-stage RISC-V processor written in SystemVerilog. It is used as the real-hardware side of an undergraduate thesis at FaMAF, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, on how closely a gem5 configuration can be made to match a real RISC-V core. The thesis will be published here once it is defended.

Everything runs inside Docker, so you do not have to install CVA6's or gem5's dependencies on your own machine.

## Prerequisites

- A **Debian-based Linux** system (Debian or Ubuntu).
- Enough disk space for the Docker images.

## The project at a glance

The project has two sides. Each one runs a test and produces a trace that a visualizer turns into a cycle-by-cycle pipeline view:

- **CVA6 (this repo)**: the real core, simulated in Verilator. `run_CVA6.py` runs a test and writes a VCD, which [CVA6Flow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/CVA6Flow) renders.
- **gem5**: the MinorCPU RISC-V model. `run_gem5.py` runs the same test and writes a debug trace, which [MinorFlow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/MinorFlow) renders.

Both run scripts also print the same metrics table (cycles, instructions, cache misses and accesses, branches, mispredictions and IPC), so the two cores can be compared directly. That comparison is the whole point of the project.

## About this fork

- Based on CVA6 **v5.3.0**. This repository is pinned at commit `0ea2362e`, and the Docker image at `v5.3.0-89-g272e6e51`.
- A **frozen fork** of CVA6. The upstream dependency submodules have been vendored into the repository, so the core builds without fetching anything external and the exact RTL is pinned.
- **The two visualizers are bundled as submodules** under `viewers/`, so a recursive clone gives you the whole toolchain in one place:
  - `viewers/MinorFlow` points to [MinorFlow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/MinorFlow)
  - `viewers/CVA6Flow` points to [CVA6Flow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/CVA6Flow)
- Target configuration: `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39_hpdcache_wb`.

Clone with the submodules to get the viewers too:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/CVA6.git
# or, if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Each viewer has the same tool for itself, `check_MinorFlow_repo.py` and `check_CVA6Flow_repo.py`, sharing this one's helpers and check protocol.                                                                                                                                              |
| `scripts/clean_CVA6_repo.py`                    | Deletes the `.list`, `.vcd`, `.fst`, traces and `__pycache__` left in this repository, then offers to run each viewer's own cleaner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `scripts/serve_viewers.py`                      | Serves the viewer pages over HTTP, so a container with no browser can put one in the host's. Both images copy it to their root, where it runs as `python3 serve_viewers.py`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `scripts/make_containers.py`                    | Creates both containers, or one, with CPU and memory limits and the viewer port published. Reads what the Docker daemon actually has, picks a build job count that fits, and refuses rather than failing partway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Everything else (`common/`, `util/`, `pd/`, `spyglass/`, `ci/`, `cva6_docs/` and so on) is standard upstream CVA6.

## The benchmarks

`benchmarks/` holds the test programs used in the project plus the driver scripts that run them on each simulator. Both drivers accept the same C and assembly tests and print the same metrics table, so results from CVA6 and gem5 can be compared directly.

- `gem5_config_CVA6/CVA6/benchmarks/`: the CVA6 tests, run by `viewers/CVA6Flow/scripts/run_CVA6.py` on the CVA6 core.
- `gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/benchmarks/`: the gem5 tests, run by `viewers/MinorFlow/scripts/run_gem5.py` on the gem5 MinorCPU RISC-V model.

A run leaves what is worth keeping in a `run_results/` folder next to the script: the trace the viewer renders, the `.list` its tracer needs, and `<test>_report.txt` with the measured region and the metrics table. The gem5 side adds `<test>_stats.txt`, gem5's own `stats.txt` renamed after the program. Everything else stays where the simulator put it: `verif/sim/out_<date>/` on the CVA6 side, `m5out/` on the gem5 side.

The `_report.txt` has two labelled sections, so either can be read or extracted on its own:

```
======================================================================
DISASSEMBLED CODE
======================================================================
   ... the measured region ...
======================================================================
END OF DISASSEMBLED CODE
======================================================================

======================================================================
RESULTS TABLE gem5 daxpy.S  ICache: 16KiB/4  DCache: 32KiB/8
Config: gem5_config_CVA6.py
======================================================================
   ... the metrics table, then the clean arrays ...
```

The title names the simulator, the program and the L1 geometries the run used. The line under it names the gem5 configuration and its flags, or the CVA6 target.

When a run **fails**, nothing is deleted. gem5's whole stdout and stderr go to `<test>_error.log` beside that run's output, and the CVA6 build and simulation go to `verif/sim/out_<date>/<test>_run.log`.

Each folder carries a `test_template.c` and a `test_template.S` to start from. Both bracket the region to measure between `MAIN PROGRAM` and `END OF MAIN PROGRAM` markers: the CVA6 side reads the hardware counters around it into `s2` to `s10`, the gem5 side wraps it in `m5_reset_stats` and `m5_dump_stats`. That region is what gets measured and disassembled, so a new test means filling it in.

Each folder also has a batch runner, for when you want the whole set instead of a single test:

```bash
python3 run_all_CVA6_benchmarks.py [folder] [--target T] [--no-vcd]   # defaults to /cva6/benchmarks/
python3 run_all_gem5_benchmarks.py <config>.py [folder] [-j N] [--variant patch|stock] [--no-trace]   # defaults to /gem5/benchmarks/
```

They collect the C and assembly tests in the folder, skip the templates, run each through the matching driver, and print a pass/fail summary. Tests sharing a name are warned about up front, since outputs are named after the test. `-r` includes subfolders, `--dry-run` lists without running.

Every test that passes has its files moved into `batch_results/` and its leftovers deleted, so the batch lands in one folder rather than a trace per test across the tree, `--out-dir` picks another. It also gathers every run's table and clean arrays into one file there, in the order the tests were listed. The file is named after the run that produced it, `metrics_<config>_<variant>_<build>_<flags>.txt`, so two batches of different builds cannot land on the same name and be mistaken for each other later. Each table inside carries a `Build:` line naming the binary and the overhead table subtracted from it.

A test that **fails** keeps everything, and the closing lines say where.

On the Verilator side only the first test builds the core. The rest reuse it through `--keep-build`, which is safe because the target and the trace setting are the same for the whole batch. Pass `--rebuild-each` to rebuild before every test.

The **gem5 batch runs several tests at once**: gem5 is single-threaded, so `-j` (4 by default) gives that many simulations in parallel, each in its own folder under `m5out/` and `run_results/` so they cannot overwrite each other's `stats.txt`.

### The calibration sweep

Matching the gem5 model to CVA6 meant perturbing one part of the pipeline at a time and comparing the result against the core. [gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/configs/gem5_config_CVA6_testing.py](gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/configs/gem5_config_CVA6_testing.py) holds that as a table of configurations, `TEST 1` being the matched baseline and every other entry a single-knob change, grouped by the part of the machine it touches, with the workloads that localize it:

```
#   1   adopted baseline                          workload: all
#   2   fetch1FetchLimit 2 -> 1                   workload: matmul_small
#  22   fp_addmul without the double mask         workload: fp_addmul
```

`run_config_search_sweep.py`, next to it, replays the whole thing. It always sweeps its own `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, the file it is written for. Run it from `/gem5`:

```bash
python3 run_config_search_sweep.py [-j N] [--configs 1,4-6] [--tests daxpy,full_test] [--variant patch|stock] [--no-trace] [--list]
```

It defaults to `--variant patch`, since `DEFAULT_CONFIG` sets parameters only the patch provides. For each configuration it sets `TEST`, runs that entry's workloads through `run_gem5.py`, and moves the results into `config_testing_sweep_results/` tagged `.config<N>`, plus one gathered metrics file named after the sweep, `metrics_<config>_<variant>...txt`. An entry whose workload is `all` runs `DEFAULT_ALL_TESTS`, the set the baseline was calibrated against, which is wider than what the perturbation rows name.

The sweep runs `-j` at once, 4 by default, each in its own folder under `m5out/` and `run_results/`, deleted once collected. A run that **fails** keeps its folder, under `m5out/config<N>_<test>/`, together with the configuration copy it ran. Both parent folders are removed only if the sweep leaves them empty, since a plain `run_gem5.py` run writes into them too.

The sweep never edits the file you point it at: it writes one temporary copy per configuration and deletes them at the end, so an interrupted sweep leaves nothing to restore and two can run at once. `--list` prints the plan without touching anything, and `--tests` takes a bare name, a file name or a path.

### Cleaning up

A VCD or a gem5 trace runs to hundreds of megabytes, and a sweep writes one per configuration per test. Each side has a script that deletes everything its run scripts generate, and nothing else:

```bash
python3 clean_gem5_runs.py [folders...] [-y] [--dry-run]
python3 clean_CVA6_runs.py [folders...] [-y] [--dry-run] [--keep-build]
```

`clean_gem5_runs.py` takes `m5out/`, `batch_results/`, the sweep result folders, the `run_results/` beside each runner, and `__pycache__/`. `clean_CVA6_runs.py` takes `verif/sim/out_<date>/`, `work-ver/`, `batch_results/`, `CVA6Flow_sweep_results`, `run_results/`, and `__pycache__/`. Extra folders can be named on the command line, for a run made with a custom `--gem5-out-dir` or `--out-dir`.

Both list what they found with its size and ask before deleting. `-y` skips the question, `--dry-run` only lists, and `--keep-build` spares `work-ver/`. Only those fixed names are matched, so nothing tracked in git is ever caught, and cleaning one side never touches the other's results.

Those two clear a run tree. `scripts/clean_CVA6_repo.py`, in the repository root, clears what piles up in this repository's own folders afterwards: every `.list`, `.vcd`, `.fst` and debug trace, and every `__pycache__`. A trace is matched on `_trace`, so a sweep's `<test>_trace.config<N>.txt` goes with the plain `<test>_trace.txt`. The `_report.txt` and `_stats.txt` beside them are the summaries and stay.

```bash
python3 scripts/clean_CVA6_repo.py [-y] [--dry-run] [-v] [--no-viewers]
```

It only ever opens `gem5_config_CVA6/` and `benchmarks/`. The two viewers are separate repositories with their own artefacts and their own rules, so it does not walk into them: it offers to run their cleaners afterwards instead, and each decides what to keep on its own side. `--no-viewers` skips the offer.

There are five cleaning scripts in all, and the names say which tree each one touches:

| Script                                      | Where              | What it deletes                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scripts/clean_CVA6_repo.py`                | repository root    | Committed-tree artefacts here, then offers the two below it                          |
| `viewers/MinorFlow/clean_MinorFlow_repo.py` | MinorFlow checkout | The same, in that repository, keeping `docs/` whole                                  |
| `viewers/CVA6Flow/clean_CVA6Flow_repo.py`   | CVA6Flow checkout  | The same, in that repository, keeping `docs/` whole                                  |
| `clean_gem5_runs.py`                        | gem5 root          | What a gem5 run leaves: `m5out/`, `batch_results/`, sweep folders, `run_results/`    |
| `clean_CVA6_runs.py`                        | CVA6 root          | What a CVA6 run leaves: `out_<date>/`, `work-ver/`, `batch_results/`, `run_results/` |

A tracer JSON survives all of that, since it is what the viewers read, but it is too big to commit: GitHub warns above 50 MiB and refuses above 100 MiB, and a full run leaves several over 200.

```bash
python3 scripts/ignore_big_CVA6_repo_jsons.py [-y] [--dry-run] [-v] [-l MIB] [--prune]
```

Run it after a sweep. It only ever adds, so a second run changes nothing. `--prune` drops the entries whose file has gone or shrunk, and `-l` sets a different threshold in MiB. A file git already tracks is reported rather than ignored, since an ignore rule has no effect on a file git is already carrying.

The benchmark scripts are kept here for version control, but each one is run inside its own Docker image, from the "Run a test" sections below.

## The matched gem5 configuration

[gem5_config_CVA6/](gem5_config_CVA6/) is where the comparison lands. It holds the gem5 MinorCPU configuration matched to `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39_hpdcache_wb`, in which every value is either derived from a CVA6 RTL localparam or is a gem5-side estimate where CVA6 has no clean counterpart.

It comes in two versions, so the same core can be run on either gem5 build:

- `gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/configs/gem5_config_CVA6.py` runs on a **stock gem5**, using only what upstream already provides.
- `gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/configs/gem5_config_CVA6_Patch.py` runs on a **patched gem5** and adds the mechanisms the patch makes available.

Each has a `_testing` twin, `gem5_config_CVA6_testing.py` and `gem5_config_CVA6_Patch_testing.py`, which is the same core wrapped in the calibration table of single-knob perturbations that `run_config_search_sweep.py` replays.

#### Why there is a patch

Some of what CVA6 does has no counterpart in stock gem5, and no parameter that comes close. A fence that walks the data cache writing back every dirty line, a load-store unit with no store-to-load forwarding, a cache that picks its victim and starts its writeback at miss time rather than at fill, direct branch targets computed in the fetch path instead of read from a BTB: each is a rule in the RTL, and each changes the cycle count by more than the calibration's error bar.

`gem5/MinorCPU_CVA6.patch` adds them, one gem5 parameter per rule, every one defaulting to the stock behaviour so a patched binary runs an unpatched configuration unchanged. That is what makes the difference measurable: the same binary runs with a mechanism on and off, and the gap is what that rule is worth.

The config [README](gem5_config_CVA6/README.md#the-patch) has the whole of it: what each change models and which RTL line it comes from, the new parameters, SimObjects and statistics, how to apply and revert the patch, and the six divergences that remain.

## Docker setup

### Installing Docker

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
sudo docker version
```

### Enabling graphical applications

To run graphical tools (for example GTKWave) from inside the container:

```bash
xhost +
socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0
```

### Optional configuration

Recommended, to make working with Docker easier.

**Start Docker automatically on boot:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

**Run Docker without `sudo`.** Replace `<user_name>` with your username (run `whoami` to get it):

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker <user_name>
newgrp docker
```

Then this should work without `sudo`:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

**Access the container from VSCode:** install the `Docker` extension from the Extensions panel.

### Managing the Docker service

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker # start
sudo systemctl status docker # check
sudo systemctl stop docker # stop
```

---

## Getting the images

Two ways: pull the published image, or build it from this working tree.

### Pulling

Two images are published on Docker Hub. Check the tags and pull the latest.

**CVA6 + Verilator** ([manuel313/cva6](https://hub.docker.com/r/manuel313/cva6/tags)):

```bash
docker pull manuel313/cva6:latest
```

**gem5 (MinorCPU)** ([manuel313/gem5_v25](https://hub.docker.com/r/manuel313/gem5_v25/tags)):

```bash
docker pull manuel313/gem5_v25:latest
```

Verify:

```bash
docker images
```

### Building

The recipes in [dockerfiles/](dockerfiles/) build the same images from **this working tree**, which is the point: both drivers hardcode the container's root, `/cva6` and `/gem5`, so an RTL file or a configuration edited on the host only reaches the simulation by being copied in. Building is how you run a modified core rather than the one the published image was made from.

Both build from the repository **root**, not from the recipe's own folder:

```bash
docker build -f dockerfiles/CVA6/Dockerfile -t famaf/cva6 .
docker build -f dockerfiles/gem5/Dockerfile -t famaf/gem5 .
```

`.dockerignore` keeps the traces, VCDs, JSONs and git history out of the build context, so what is uploaded to the daemon is a few tens of megabytes rather than the whole tree.

**These are heavy builds.** The cost is the RISC-V toolchain on the CVA6 side and two full gem5 builds on the gem5 side.

|              | Disk while building | Finished image | Time     | Memory per job |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `famaf/cva6` | ~30 GB              | ~14 GB         | 2 to 4 h | ~2 GB          |
| `famaf/gem5` | ~25 GB              | ~12 GB         | 1 to 3 h | ~4 GB          |

Memory is what actually fails a build, and it fails as a compiler killed with no useful message. Both recipes take a `JOBS` argument, and it should be no higher than your RAM in GB divided by the per-job figure above:

```bash
docker build --build-arg JOBS=2 -f dockerfiles/gem5/Dockerfile -t famaf/gem5 .
```

On Docker Desktop the VM has its own memory cap, in Settings, Resources, and it is what the build sees rather than the host's. The Linux engine has no such cap. `docker system prune` frees the space earlier attempts left behind.

The two images carry different halves of the project on purpose. `famaf/cva6` has the RTL, the CVA6 benchmarks and CVA6Flow, with the gem5 configurations, the gem5 benchmarks and MinorFlow removed. `famaf/gem5` has gem5 built twice, the two configurations, the gem5 benchmarks and MinorFlow. Both put the drivers at the root, which is where the commands below are run from.

---

## Moving files in and out

The images carry their own copy of the repository, `/cva6` in the CVA6 image and `/gem5` in the gem5 one, so a benchmark you edit on the host is not the one the container runs. `docker cp` moves it either way, with the container stopped or running:

```bash
# host -> container: a test and the scripts that run it
docker cp gem5_config_CVA6/CVA6/benchmarks/daxpy.S       cva6:/cva6/benchmarks/
docker cp viewers/CVA6Flow/scripts/run_CVA6.py   cva6:/cva6/
docker cp gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/benchmarks/daxpy.S       gem5:/gem5/benchmarks/
docker cp viewers/MinorFlow/scripts/run_gem5.py   gem5:/gem5/
docker cp gem5_config_CVA6/gem5/.       gem5:/gem5/

# container -> host: what a run produced
docker cp cva6:/cva6/run_results/                ./run_results/
docker cp gem5:/gem5/batch_results/              ./batch_results/
docker cp gem5:/gem5/config_testing_sweep_results/ ./
```

A trailing `/.` on the source copies the contents of a folder rather than the folder itself.

`scripts/docker_sync.py` does both directions without the paths. Four things to do, one word each, and the container is `cva6`, `gem5`, or left out for both:

```bash
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py push      # send this checkout in
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py pull      # bring the results back
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py trace     # pull, then make the viewer JSONs
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py list      # show what is in there, copy nothing

python3 scripts/docker_sync.py push gem5 # one container
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py trace -y  # take every folder without asking
python3 scripts/docker_sync.py push -n   # say what would be copied
```

**push** sends, per container:

| What                                              | Where it lands                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| The drivers, the sweeps and the cleaner           | the container root, `/gem5` or `/cva6`                   |
| The gem5 configurations and `MinorCPU_CVA6.patch` | `/gem5/`                                                 |
| The CVA6Flow configuration package                | `/cva6/core/include/`, which is where the build reads it |
| The calibration benchmarks                        | `benchmarks/`                                            |
| The viewer's teaching set                         | `MinorFlow_benchmarks/` or `CVA6Flow_benchmarks/`        |
| The viewer page, its tracer and its batch tracer  | `viewers/<viewer>/`                                      |
| `serve_viewers.py`                                | the container root                                       |

It is the one to remember: a container keeps its own copy of everything, so editing `run_gem5.py` here changes nothing inside until it is pushed.

The configuration package is the CVA6Flow one, which carries the seventeen-configuration table and `CVA6_CONFIG_SEL`, and it replaces the live package. Its default selector is `CFG_BASELINE`, so a plain run still gets the baseline, and `run_CVA6Flow_sweep.py` reads the file once before it writes, so source and live being the same file is safe.

**pull** lists the run-output folders that actually exist, with their sizes and what produced them, and asks which to bring back. That list comes from the cleaners, so it cannot fall out of step with them. Folders land in `container_results/<container>/`. **trace** is `pull` followed by the viewer's batch tracer over whatever came back.

## Working with the CVA6 image

### Create the container

Create a container named `cva6` with a Bash terminal and permission to run graphical applications:

```bash
docker run -it --name cva6 -p 8000:8000 \
           -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
           manuel313/cva6:latest bash
```

`-p 8000:8000` is what lets `serve_viewers.py` put CVA6Flow in the host's browser later.

Or let [`scripts/make_containers.py`](scripts/make_containers.py) do it. It reads what the Docker daemon actually has, publishes the port, passes the display through, and caps CPU and memory so a simulation cannot take the machine down with it:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_containers.py --check    # what this machine can do
python3 scripts/make_containers.py --pull     # both containers
python3 scripts/make_containers.py cva6       # just this one
```

It refuses rather than failing partway when memory or disk is short, leaves an existing container alone unless `--force` says otherwise, and `-n` prints the commands without running them. With `--build` it builds from this working tree instead of pulling, choosing a `JOBS` value from the daemon's memory rather than the default in the recipe.

Type `exit` to leave.

### Start, enter and stop

```bash
docker start cva6 # start
docker exec -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -it cva6 bash # enter
docker stop cva6 # stop
```

### Run a test

Optionally sanity-check that the C compiles on the host first:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O3 -g -std=c99 -o <executable_name> <program_name>.c
./<executable_name>
```

Then run it on the Verilated CVA6 to produce the VCD trace and the metrics table:

```bash
python3 run_CVA6.py [target] <test> [--lang c|asm] [--no-vcd] [--keep-build]
```

- `[target]`: the CVA6 configuration. Optional, and defaults to `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39_hpdcache_wb`, the one this fork targets and the one the overhead tables were measured on. The cache geometry printed in the table's title is read from that target's `core/include/<target>_config_pkg.sv`.
- `<test>`: a `.c` or `.S/.s/.asm` file. The type is auto-detected from the extension, and `--lang` forces it.
- `--no-vcd`: skip the trace and report metrics only.
- `--keep-build`: reuse the Verilated model in `work-ver` instead of rebuilding it. The model does not depend on the test, so this turns a rebuild into a plain run. Only reuse it across runs with the same target and the same trace setting, since both are compiled into the model.

It compiles the test, runs it on the Verilated CVA6, disassembles it, and prints a metrics table (cycles, instructions, cache misses and accesses, branches, mispredictions, time and IPC) with a configurable "net" column that discounts the fixed cost of the measurement code.

The simulation writes to `verif/sim/out_<date>/` as usual, and the three files worth keeping, the VCD, the `.list` and the `<test>_report.txt` with the measured region and the table, are copied to a `run_results/` folder next to the script.

A VCD is written by default. **The viewer does not read it directly.** Turn it into a viewer JSON first, passing the `.list` beside it, which is where the instruction text comes from:

```bash
python3 viewers/CVA6Flow/CVA6Flow_tracer.py run_results/daxpy.vcd \
        --disasm-list run_results/daxpy.list -o daxpy.json
```

Then open `daxpy.json` in [CVA6Flow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/CVA6Flow). The tracer finds the listing on its own when it sits beside the VCD under the same name, so `--disasm-list` is only needed when it does not. `viewers/CVA6Flow/scripts/create_all_CVA6Flow_jsons.py` does a whole folder at a time, and `scripts/create_all_CVA6_repo_jsons.py` does the whole checkout.

To use the viewer from inside the container, serve it and open the page on the host:

```bash
python3 serve_viewers.py            # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

The container has to be started with the port published, `docker run -p 8000:8000 ...`.

### Limitations and considerations

**C programs:**

- Only `stdio.h`, `stdint.h` and `string.h` are available.
- `malloc` and `free` cannot be used.

**`veri-testharness` simulator:**

- The core runs for at most 2 million cycles or 500 seconds, whichever comes first.

## Working with the gem5 image

### Create the container

Create a container named `gem5` with a Bash terminal

```bash
docker run -it --name gem5 -p 8000:8000 manuel313/gem5_v25 bash
```

Type `exit` to leave.

### Start, enter and stop

```bash
docker start gem5 # start
docker exec -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -it gem5 bash # enter
docker stop gem5 # stop
```

### Run a test

From `/gem5`, run a test to produce its debug trace and the metrics table:

```bash
python3 run_gem5.py <config>.py <test> [--variant patch|stock] [--lang c|asm] [--no-trace]
```

- `<config>.py`: the gem5 MinorCPU configuration script.
- `<test>`: a `.c` or `.S/.s/.asm` file, auto-detected as above (`--lang` to force).
- `--variant`: which build to run, `stock` (default) or `patch`. It picks both the binary, `build/RISCV/` or `build/RISCV_PATCH/`, and the overhead profile measured on that build. The chosen build is named in the table header.
- The two builds are indistinguishable from the outside, so before each run the script greps the binary for a SimObject only the patch adds and refuses to start when it does not match `--variant`. `--skip-build-check` runs anyway, for a deliberate cross-check where the NET figures are known not to apply.
- `--build`: run any other build instead, by directory name under `build/`, by path to one, or by path to the binary. The overhead profile still follows `--variant`.
- `--no-trace`: skip the trace and report metrics only.
- anything else: passed on to the configuration script, so a configuration that defines its own options gets them here. Put them after a `--` when a flag takes a value or its name collides with one of the above.

It compiles the test (linking gem5's `m5op.S` so the test can call `m5_reset_stats` and `m5_dump_stats`), runs gem5 into `m5out/`, disassembles the test, and prints the same metrics table as the CVA6 side, read from gem5's `stats.txt`.

On a patched build the table carries a third column, `NET (CVA6)`, beside `NET`. The HPDcache PMU re-presents a demand on every cycle it holds a request off, so the core's access counts run above gem5's. The patch counts those cycles, under whichever of its two forms is configured: blocking charges `preemptionBlockedCycles`, and accept-and-charge, which the production configuration uses, charges `windowTriggerCycles` and `windowOverlapCycles` instead. The column adds all three to the two cache-access rows, which is what the patch's own `cva6ComparableDemandAccesses` adds up, so the gem5 table can be read against the CVA6 one row for row.

gem5 writes to `m5out/`, and the test is compiled there too, so a run is self-contained. The four keepers, the trace, the `.list`, `<test>_report.txt` and `<test>_stats.txt`, are copied to `run_results/` next to the script. `--gem5-out-dir` and `--results-dir` move either folder, which is how concurrent runs stay apart.

The trace is `run_results/<test>_trace.txt`. **The viewer does not read it directly.** Turn it into a viewer JSON first, which is what MinorFlow loads:

```bash
python3 viewers/MinorFlow/MinorFlow_tracer.py run_results/daxpy_trace.txt -o daxpy.json
```

Then open `daxpy.json` in [MinorFlow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/MinorFlow). Parsing the trace once on disk is what lets a multi-gigabyte run open in a browser at all. `viewers/MinorFlow/scripts/create_all_MinorFlow_jsons.py` does a whole folder at a time, and `scripts/create_all_CVA6_repo_jsons.py` does the whole checkout.

To use the viewer from inside the container, serve it and open the page on the host, which needs no browser in the image and no X11:

```bash
python3 serve_viewers.py            # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

The container has to be started with the port published, `docker run -p 8000:8000 ...`.

## The visualizers

Both are single, dependency-free HTML files with a live demo on GitHub Pages:

- [CVA6Flow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/CVA6Flow): renders the VCD `run_CVA6.py` produces, after `CVA6Flow_tracer.py` has turned it into JSON.
- [MinorFlow](https://github.com/FaMAF-CVA6-Project/MinorFlow): renders the debug trace `run_gem5.py` produces, after `MinorFlow_tracer.py` has turned it into JSON.

Neither reads the raw trace: a run leaves gigabytes and a browser cannot hold that, so the tracer does the parsing once on disk and the viewer loads the result.

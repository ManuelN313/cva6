`DEFAULT_ALL_TESTS` in the sweep names **sixteen** programs, and every entry whose workload is `all` runs all sixteen. Fourteen of them are the comparison suite: `atomic_fence`, `basic_test`, `branch_full_test`, `btb_pressure`, `daxpy`, `daxpy_unrolling_4`, `fetch2_probe`, `fp_addmul`, `fp_divsqrt`, `full_test`, `icache_pressure`, `int_div`, `matmul_small` and `store_fwd`.

The other two, `fp_divsqrt_probe` and `fp_divsqrt_probe2`, are **not** suite members and are left out of the comparison. They are diagnostic programs written to measure one limitation rather than to be matched: each drives the FP divider with operands chosen so the hardware's short path fires and the model's general law does not, which is what turns that divergence into a number instead of a suspicion.

They all live in [gem5/benchmarks/](gem5/benchmarks/) and [CVA6/benchmarks/](CVA6/benchmarks/).

## The matched configuration

It comes in two versions. `gem5_config_CVA6.py` runs on a **stock gem5**, using only what upstream already provides, so it works against an unmodified build. `gem5_config_CVA6_Patch.py` runs on a **patched gem5** and adds the mechanisms the patch makes available. Each has a `_testing` twin carrying the calibration table.

Both target `cv64a6_imafdc_sv39_hpdcache_wb` at 50 MHz, with a 16 KiB L1I and a 32 KiB L1D. Every value is either derived from a CVA6 RTL localparam or is a gem5-side estimate where CVA6 has no clean counterpart.

Run either like any other gem5 config:

```bash
python3 run_gem5.py gem5_config_CVA6.py <test>         # stock gem5
python3 run_gem5.py gem5_config_CVA6_Patch.py <test>   # patched gem5
```

In the patched version every transcribed mechanism is on by default and each has a `--no-` switch that turns it off, so it doubles as its own ablation harness. `--no-patch` is all of them at once, which reproduces the stock MinorCPU behaviour the calibration started from. It turns the mechanisms off, not the geometry: the fetch queues stay at 3 where the stock configuration uses 2. The stock configuration takes no switches, since it carries none of these mechanisms.

**The two arms differ by geometry as well as by mechanism, and the comparison should say so.** `fetch1FetchLimit` and `fetch2InputBufferSize` are both 2 in `gem5_config_CVA6.py` and both 3 in `gem5_config_CVA6_Patch.py`, while the TEST grid states its deltas against a baseline of `fetch1FetchLimit 2` (rows 2, 3, 75, 76). The 3/3 value is defensible on RTL grounds, since the I-cache holds three lines in flight with a three-deep Fetch2 buffer, but it means the patched and unpatched figures are not separated by the mechanisms alone. It is not a small effect, and on this suite it is not a second-order one either.

### The calibration table

`gem5_config_CVA6_Patch_testing.py` is the campaign in one file. `TEST 1` is the frozen CPU-side baseline, `TEST 99` is the full production configuration, and every other entry is a single-knob perturbation.

The table is ordered by what an entry needs to run, then by the part of the machine it touches, front of the pipeline first. `gem5_config_CVA6_testing.py` carries the first tier, `TEST 1` to `TEST 39`, under the same numbers, so a row means the same thing in both files.

**TESTS 1 to 39 run on a stock gem5.**

## The patch

`MinorCPU_CVA6.patch` is the whole gem5 side in one file, verified to apply cleanly on pristine v25.0.0.1 with both `git apply` and `patch`, and to revert to a byte-identical tree. Every behaviour it adds is a transcription of a specific RTL rule, every one is behind a parameter that defaults to the stock behaviour, and every one carries its citation in the source comments. A patched gem5 runs unpatched configurations unchanged.

### Applying it

Run from the gem5 source root. The paths carry `a/` and `b/` prefixes, so the default strip level is right and no `-p` flag is needed.

```bash
cd /gem5
git apply --check MinorCPU_CVA6.patch    # dry run, silent on success
git apply MinorCPU_CVA6.patch
scons defconfig build/RISCV_PATCH build_opts/RISCV
scons build/RISCV_PATCH/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

The build directory is `RISCV_PATCH` and not `RISCV` because this project keeps `build/RISCV` as the stock binary. Building the patch into it would overwrite that, and nothing afterwards would say so.

The rebuild is not optional. The patch adds SimObjects and `SConscript` entries, so the generated Python parameter set changes and an existing `build/` will not pick the new parameters up on its own.

`patch -p1 < MinorCPU_CVA6.patch` works the same way outside a git checkout and produces a byte-identical tree.

### Reverting it

Feed the same file back with `-R`. Both tools restore the 22 edited files and delete the 9 created ones, leaving a tree that `git status` reports as clean.

```bash
cd /gem5
git apply -R MinorCPU_CVA6.patch          # or: patch -R -p1 < MinorCPU_CVA6.patch
scons build/RISCV_PATCH/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

That rebuild turns `build/RISCV_PATCH` back into a stock binary, which is rarely what you want. If a stock binary is all you need, `build/RISCV` already is one and nothing has to be rebuilt.

[`run_gem5.py`](../viewers/MinorFlow/scripts/run_gem5.py) takes `--variant stock`, the default, or `--variant patch`, which picks the binary and the overhead profile together and names the build in the table header. `--build` runs any other build directory without changing the profile.

Since every added parameter defaults off, the patched binary running `gem5_config_CVA6.py` should reproduce the stock binary exactly. Diffing the two `stats.txt` files is the test of that, and any line that differs is a mechanism leaking when it should be inert. `gem5_config_CVA6_Patch.py --no-patch` is the same test from the other direction, holding the configuration fixed and turning the mechanisms off.

### TO DO

- **No entry isolates the direct-target knob against today's stack.** `TEST 58`, "production minus direct targets", was written before the RAS model existed, so its era's production stack had no unrecovered RAS and its empty `bp_overrides` was right then. `--no-cva6-direct-targets` no longer implies `--no-ras-decay`, so measuring that switch against the current stack needs a row carrying `rasNoRecovery` without `directTargetsFromDecode`. Nothing is wrong in the table as it stands, it just no longer covers that one ablation.
- **Measure the assembly overhead profile on a patched build.** `OVERHEAD_SUITES["config"]["patch"]` in [run_gem5.py](../viewers/MinorFlow/scripts/run_gem5.py) has identical numbers for C and assembly, on all eight entries. The stock profile differs between the two languages on four of them, and the two paths link different startup code, so one measurement was most likely copied rather than two taken. It moves the NET figures on every assembly benchmark if it is wrong.

The metrics table uses three of these: `preemptionBlockedCycles`, `windowTriggerCycles` and `windowOverlapCycles`. `run_gem5.py` adds them to the cache-access rows and prints the result as a third column, `NET (CVA6)`, next to `NET`, so a gem5 table reads against a CVA6 one row for row.

The three count disjoint cycles, so summing them is right whichever form is configured, and the sum is what `cva6ComparableDemandAccesses` reports. Accept-and-charge replaces the **readout and refill-window** blocks specifically, causes 3 and 5. The other blocking causes, no-MSHRs, no-write-buffers, no-targets and the fence flush, still block under either form, so a single run carries both kinds.

### What each change models, briefly

**Instruction-side miss acceptance.** The L1I holds two MSHRs, a stock parameter. With one, the line Fetch1 requests during a miss is refused and retried off the clock edge, a tax CVA6 never pays: its icache takes no request during a miss and the frontend presents the next line the cycle the first returns (`cva6_icache.sv` MISS state). With two, the request coalesces or queues at the memory port, and miss chains land at CVA6's one fill per five cycles. Two was a stand-in for structure the model lacked, replaced below. The harness reads `overallMshrMisses` on both caches, the refill count the PMU counts.

**The structural instruction side.** Four parameters replace that MSHR count with the shape the RTL has, all four on by default. `fetch1WaitsForIcache` holds a line at the ready line instead of paying a refusal and a retry, since `cva6_icache.sv` asserts `dreq_o.ready` only in IDLE and READ. `fetch1KillsOnRedirect` frees every in-flight line's fetch slot at the redirect, the frontend side of `kill_s1` and `kill_s2` (327 to 348). `fill_ready_at_fill` makes a block readable at the fill instant, since the icache writes the line in the fill-ack cycle (316 to 325), so the bus terms are not charged twice. `reopen_at_ready` defers the full-MSHR retry until that block is readable. The L1I then runs at one MSHR, the hardware's number, and `TESTS 89` to `95` separate the four.

**Fetch cadence.** CVA6's icache accepts a hit request every cycle in its READ state (`cva6_icache.sv` 263 to 287). Minor's Fetch2 with `fetch2CycleInput` false takes the next line a cycle after exhausting one (`fetch2.cc` 526), half the rate. The configuration sets it true. A stock parameter, not a patch, and the published empirical configuration already carried it.

**Front end.** CVA6 computes direct-branch and jump targets in the fetch path and consults its BTB only for JALR, whose entries are tagless and written on a mispredict (`frontend.sv`, `btb.sv`). The patch adds the decode-target model, and the configuration then drops the indirect predictor and the BTB tag and signals fetch2 predictions to fetch1 in the same cycle, matching CVA6's one-bubble re-steer against Minor's two.

**Store forwarding.** CVA6 has no store-to-load forwarding path. Its load unit parks a load in `WAIT_PAGE_OFFSET` until the store buffer drains whenever the address collides with a pending store (`load_unit.sv`, and `page_offset_matches_o` in `store_buffer.sv`, an eight-byte granule). Restarting that load costs two more cycles, since neither `IDLE` nor `WAIT_PAGE_OFFSET` asserts `data_req`.

**The memory port.** The testbench adapter (`axi2mem.sv`) is single-ported and holds one transaction end to end, testing `ar_valid` before `aw_valid` so reads always win. It adds no latency when uncontended, so contention appears only as admission wait.

**Eviction phase.** The HPDcache selects its victim and issues the dirty writeback at MSHR allocation, not at fill (`hpdcache_miss_handler.sv`). That readout occupies the data array for `clWords / accessWords` cycles, 2 for the 16-byte line, and the array is single-ported across five requesters (`hpdcache_memctrl.sv`).

**Victim policy.** The build configures `HPDCACHE_VICTIM_RANDOM`, not the PLRU branch: one global LFSR shared by the whole cache, shifting only when the random tier fires. Validated against a VCD probe at 7,406 of 7,406 selections, and it predicts the real machine's writeback counts to within one percent at 16, 32 and 64 KiB and at 2-way.

**Readable victim.** CVA6's directory update is pipelined, so an access one cycle behind an allocation still hits the line being displaced. gem5 re-tags synchronously and would lose it. Without this a random policy costs about 514 spurious misses on daxpy.

**Fill instant.** CVA6's clean misses complete around 9 cycles and its dirty-eviction misses later by the victim readout, 2 cycles for the 16-byte line, plus a class term per trigger: +1 for a load with no other miss outstanding, +4 for a store through the replay table (`hpdcache_rtab.sv` POP_TRY, `hpdcache_flush.sv`). The configuration now charges nothing flat and lets the readout window carry the base and its extras on the triggering miss's own fill. A request arriving inside an open window takes the overlap as its own latency, as the HPDcache stalls it in stage 0 (`hpdcache_ctrl_pe.sv` 338 to 348), and the port never refuses, since a refusal in Minor costs a rounded-up retry cycle and freezes the LSQ (`base.cc` 184, `lsq.cc` 1247), which the RTL does not do.

**Integer divider turnaround.** `serdiv.sv` returns to IDLE the cycle after FINISH clears (lines 178 to 215), so consecutive independent divides issue 12 apart where the data-dependent latency alone gives 11. `issueLat 3` on the divide unit carries it.

**Fence squash.** A committed full fence squashes the pipeline and restarts fetch at the next PC, rule F5 (`controller.sv` 123 to 136). On this configuration the re-fetch completes inside the flush walk, so the tables are unchanged by it.

**Fence flush.** A fence flushes the D-cache when `DcacheFlushOnFence` is set, which it is for this build (`controller.sv`). The core drives that as a dedicated wire rather than a bus transaction, so `executeLSQFenceSignalsDcache` sends it functionally and `fence_flushes_dcache` decides whether the cache acts on it. The walk costs 2 cycles per line (`hpdcache_cmo.sv`), counted during the walk so it scales with cache geometry.

**Instruction cache policy.** A separate module from the HPDcache with its own two-tier policy and its own LFSR (`cva6_icache.sv` plus PULP's `lfsr.sv`), advancing only on a fill into an already full set. This buys exactness rather than accuracy, since gem5's stock `RandomRP` is already in the same class.

## Known limitations

Six divergences remain, each with a named mechanism.

> **The prices below are not current.** Each was measured against the results table that used to head this file, which the shipped configuration does not reproduce, so every figure quoted as an error against the hardware has been removed from this section and the remaining cycle counts need re-reading. They return with the table.

**The FP divider's short path.** The hardware divides and takes square roots of small-mantissa operands in 10 cycles where full-mantissa operands take 15 and 22, the general law the model carries. The trigger is the mantissa length of both divide operands and of the radicand for the root, and a seven-bit radicand still runs short, by 5 and 4. Two probes measured it across fifteen chain blocks, and it is absent from `control_mvp.sv` and `preprocess_mvp.sv` at cvfpu revision 272e6e5, the one the hardware runs, so it is not transcribed.

**The fetch-cadence residue, a priced queue depth.** `basic_test`'s uncompressed sections recovered about 38 of the 49 cycles per pass the cadence fix predicted. The remaining 11 are a second beat: the fetch round trip is 3 cycles, and with `fetch1FetchLimit` and `fetch2InputBufferSize` both at 2 the requests go out two lines every three cycles. Depth 3 was tested and declined on the stack of the day, `basic_test` recovering cycles while `btb_pressure` paid more and the run-ahead gauge moved past the hardware. The structural I-side reopened it, since holding at the ready line and killing on a redirect both bound the run-ahead that reading paid for, and the adopted depth is now 3. `TEST 86` and `TEST 91` separate the depth from the mechanisms, and this residue needs re-reading against them.

**daxpy's miss count under the fill split.** With the readout window charging the trigger's own fill instead of a flat delay on every fill, the relative phase of the three streams inside a set changes and the transcribed random policy names a different way on its third visit to each set: 6,595 misses against the hardware's 6,147, worth 379 cycles because Minor's single outstanding miss overlaps most of each with the FP chain. The tier probe shows the same tiers firing at the same rates, so the difference is the LFSR phase.

**Miss-level parallelism at one.** Minor serialises demand misses where the HPDcache overlaps a second. Its visible cost on this suite is gone with the fill split, but the structure stands and the port model's calibration absorbs it.

**Instruction-side pair timing under two MSHRs.** Isolated queued miss pairs land about two cycles faster than the hardware, the second fill arriving at the port's occupancy behind the first rather than CVA6's full five-cycle re-present. Chains match and pairs undershoot. This entry is written for the two-MSHR stack and the shipped configuration runs at one, so it needs re-reading against the structural I-side as well as against the new table. The residue is the port model's occupancy against the icache's re-present interval, documented rather than tuned.

**Instruction-side access counts.** CVA6's PMU counts every fetch it presents, including the wrong-path lines its deeper run-ahead issues and kills, which gem5 never issues. The cadence fix widens that gap slightly, since faster instruction flow resolves branches sooner and fetches fewer wrong-path lines. I-miss counts match on every row. I-access counts are a behavioural difference, reported rather than compared.

"""Remove the heavy run artefacts from THIS repository's own folders: every
.list, .vcd, .fst and debug trace, and every __pycache__.

Only PROJECT_DIRS is looked at, since upstream CVA6 keeps hand-written .list
manifests the build reads.

The two viewers are separate repositories with their own artefacts and their
own rules, so this script does not reach into them. It offers to run their
scripts afterwards instead, and those decide what to keep on their own side.

  python3 clean_CVA6_repo.py               # list, then ask
  python3 clean_CVA6_repo.py -y            # delete without asking
  python3 clean_CVA6_repo.py --dry-run     # list only
  python3 clean_CVA6_repo.py --no-viewers  # skip the submodule offer

See also clean_gem5_runs.py and clean_CVA6_runs.py, which delete what a run
leaves behind rather than what is committed.
